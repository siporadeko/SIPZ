    Part 1: Design Research and Planning
  </h1>


  <p style="font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; font-weight: normal; margin-bottom: 3em;">
  <h2>The Daily Annoyance and Design Thinking</h2>

<p>
For this project, I focused on a recurring annoyance  not only my daily life as a content creator, but in others as well. When I film videos for fun, lighting is often a challenge because high quality ring lights are expensive and hard to transport. I often end up holding a selfie light in one hand while trying to use my iPhone with the other, which makes filming awkward and limits my movement.
</p>

<p>
By applying the Design Thinking process through observing this issue and defining the need, I planned a small “micro-upgrade” that combines these two tools I found on Thangs.com into one portable station. The goal is to make filming feel more automatic by guiding the placement and docking of both the phone and the light source.

    <img src="assets/tool2dp2.png" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 8px;">
  </div>

</p>

<h2>Systematic Inventive Thinking (SIT) Pattern</h2>

<p>
I am using the Task Unification SIT pattern for this remix. This pattern takes an existing object, a standard phone holder, and gives it an additional function by also holding an external selfie light.
</p>

<p>
Based on my initial sketches, the design includes a tilted backbone to support the iPhone and a small lip at the bottom to prevent the phone from slipping off the stand. By unifying these tasks, the holder becomes a dedicated interface where a light can be clipped directly onto the top of the stand and aimed at the subject in front of the phone.
</p>

<h2>Design Goals and Success Metrics</h2>

<p>
This remix is designed to measurably improve my day by meeting several key project criteria:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Improves Comfort and Accessibility:</strong> By unifying the light and phone, it allows for easier one-handed use.</li>

  <li><strong>Improves Reliability:</strong> The design ensures the iPhone will not slip, wobble, or fall during a shoot.</li>

  <li><strong>Saves Time:</strong> It offers a way to attach a selfie light quickly, making a repeated action more "automatic" than setting up bulky equipment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Addressing Constraints and Planning</h2>

<p>
To ensure a successful output on the Prusa MINI+, I have planned the following constraints:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Max Footprint:</strong> The design will be "palm-sized" to fit within the printer's comfort zone.</li>

  <li><strong>Material Reality:</strong> I will use PLA only, focusing on creating a sturdy base.</li>

  <li><strong>Real Use Requirement:</strong> The stand is specifically designed to work with a real object I own: my iPhone and my specific selfie light.</li>

  <li><strong>Printability:</strong> My plan involves sketching a design that prefers minimal supports to ensure the best possible surface finish in PLA.</li>
</ul>

    Part 2: Tinkercad Remix
  </h1>


  <h2>Implementation and Workflow</h2>

<p>
I used Tinkercad to realize my design by importing two public STL files. Following the Task Unification pattern, I combined a basic phone stand with a mounting interface to create a single, unified object.
</p>

<p>
My design process involved drawing and adding elements to the public models to ensure the iPhone would sit on a tilted backbone with a bottom lip to prevent slipping. This workflow allowed me to repurpose elements from existing designs to solve my specific challenge of holding a selfie light while filming.
</p>

<h2>Optimization for 3D Printing</h2>

<p>
In planning for the Prusa MINI+, I addressed several key constraints to help the print succeed:
</p>

<ul class="doc-list">
  <li><strong>Max Footprint:</strong> I kept the design "palm-sized" to stay within the printer's comfort zone.</li>
  <li><strong>Material Reality:</strong> I used PLA, which successfully created a sturdy and reliable base.</li>
  <li><strong>Real Use:</strong> I verified that the phone holder interface worked perfectly with my real iPhone.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Slicing and Technical Reflection</h2>

<p>
I exported my design as an STL file and sliced it using PrusaSlicer. While the base of the model printed successfully, the testing phase of the Design Thinking process revealed a critical issue.
</p>

<p>
The attachment on the back of the stand, which was designed to hold the selfie light, failed to print properly because I underestimated the overhang and did not add the necessary supports. This experience emphasized the importance of printability and the need to account for how gravity affects PLA when printing more complex features.
</p>

<h2>Lessons for Iteration</h2>

<p>
While the phone holding portion of the remix was successful, the failure of the light attachment clearly informs the next steps for Part 3.
</p>

<p>
In the next phase, I will transition to OnShape and use parametric modeling to refine the geometry of the attachment. My plan is to either redesign the attachment so it is self-supporting or adjust the slicer settings to include proper supports, ensuring the light clipping feature functions as intended.
</p>

    Part 3: OnShape Remix
  </h1>

  <h2>Reflection and Iteration</h2>

<p>
After evaluating the 3D print from Part 2, I identified two major areas for improvement: functional utility and print reliability.
</p>

<p>
While the Tinkercad version held the phone well, it lacked a way to power the device during long filming sessions, and the selfie light attachment failed to print entirely. For this remix, I imported my previous STL into OnShape to utilize its parametric solid modeling tools, which allow for more precise adjustments to the geometry.
</p>

<h2>Design Improvements and New Features</h2>

<p>
I introduced two significant changes in this version to improve the fit and function of the mount:
</p>

<ul class="doc-list">
  <li><strong>Charging Port Integration:</strong> I added a dedicated hole in the base of the stand to accommodate a charging cable. This ensures the phone can remain powered while on the stand, fulfilling the goal of making the device more reliable for long-term use.</li>

  <li><strong>Selfie Light Attachment:</strong> I re-attempted the selfie light interface at the top of the backbone. Using OnShape’s precise sketching tools, I refined the attachment point to ensure a better fit for my specific light.</li>

  <li><strong>Aesthetic Choice:</strong> I decided to change the filament color to blue to give the design a more fun and vibrant look.</li>
   <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); gap: 1.5em;">
    <img src="assets/improve.png" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 8px;">
    <img src="assets/dp2 onshape hole improve.png" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 8px;">
  </div>
</ul>

<h2>Technical Optimization and "Stranger Things" Aesthetic</h2>

<p>
The most critical change for this iteration was the strategic planning for 3D print supports. My first print failed because I underestimated the overhangs of the light attachment.
</p>

<ul class="doc-list">
  <li><strong>Support Strategy:</strong> I incorporated extensive support structures throughout the tilted backbone and under the light attachment interface.</li>

  <li><strong>Print Time:</strong> Adding these necessary supports increased the total print time on the Prusa MINI+ to 8 hours—adding 5 additional hours to the original 3-hour print time.</li>

  <li><strong>Visual Outcome:</strong> Interestingly, the abundance of supports ended up looking very "cool and superficial." One of my peers, Sandra, commented that the organic, textured look of the supports gave the piece a "Stranger Things" kind of design, reminiscent of the "Upside Down." This accidental aesthetic added a unique character to the final 3D output.</li>
    <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); gap: 1.5em;">
   <img src="assets/strangerthings.png" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 8px;">
   <img src="assets/stsdes.jpeg" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 8px;">
</ul>

<h2>Slicing and Final Print</h2>

<p>
I exported the new STL from OnShape and used PrusaSlicer to carefully manage these complex support structures. By addressing the previous failures and embracing the necessary technical constraints, I successfully printed a functional, dual-purpose mount that supports both my phone and its light source while allowing for simultaneous charging.

    Part 4: Design Retrospective  </h1>

  <h2>Reflecting on the Process: From Failure to Success</h2>

<p>
Like most designers, I initially wanted my project to work out perfectly on the first try. However, the fact that my Tinkercad print failed at the beginning turned out to be a vital learning moment.
</p>

<p>
It forced me to move beyond simple remixing and into the more technical world of OnShape to solve the structural issues. By failing early, I was able to observe the physical limitations of PLA and the Prusa MINI+. This resulted in a final product that was actually better than my original plan, as it now includes a charging port and a much sturdier light attachment.
</p>

<h2>Comparison of Tinkercad and OnShape</h2>

<p>
Advantages and disadvantages of each tool:
</p>

<ul class="doc-list">
  <li><strong>Tinkercad:</strong> Excellent for the initial concept and combining 3D mesh files like STLs. Disadvantage: lack of precision for complex mechanical interfaces.</li>

  <li><strong>OnShape:</strong> Parametric modeling allowed iteration on fit, form, and function with much higher accuracy. While the learning curve was steeper, the ability to define exact hole sizes for the charging port was a major advantage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Output Reflection</h2>

<ul class="doc-list">
  <li><strong>Goal Achievement:</strong> My design successfully achieved the goal of creating a micro-upgrade that improves comfort and makes a repeated action more automatic.</li>

  <li><strong>Influencing Factors:</strong> Every step, from the initial paper sketch to technical slicing in PrusaSlicer, influenced the final output.</li>

  <li><strong>Future Optimization:</strong> In the future, I could optimize the design further by changing the orientation of the print to reduce the 8-hour print time without losing the stability of the charging port and light mount.</li>
